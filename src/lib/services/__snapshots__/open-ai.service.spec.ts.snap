The variety of installations possible for this shower floor may require procedures other than those shown. Plan ahead to ensure that stud wall framework construction is correctly sized, plumb, and square. The key to a good shower floor installation is proper fit within the stud wall framework. Remember these important points to ensure a smooth installation. • Completely read and understand this manual and the appropriate shower solid surface wall panel installation manual prior to beginning the project. • Measure the actual shower floor and use these dimensions to build or modify the stud wall framework to fit. A 3/16” gap between the framework and the Swanstone shower floor flange is acceptable. Installation Options The shower floor can be installed with the flange directly against the stud wall framework and 1/2” moisture-resistant wall board installed above the shower floor flange. The shower floor can be installed with the flange directly against the stud wall framework and a Swan Corporation SA Series Alcove Wall Kit can be installed directly onto the wall stud framework. Refer to the alcove wall kit manual for more information, prior to building/modifying the framework. The shower floor can be installed with the flange against existing moisture-resistant wall board with a second layer of 1/2” moisture-resistant wall board added above the shower floor flange. If installing a Swan Corporation Alcove Wall Kit in conjunction with the shower floor, note that the alcove side panels are designed to extend out past the edge of the shower floor. Read the Alcove Wall Kit installation manual and build the framework to the specifications outlined in that publication. Framework Construction 1. Measure the actual shower floor prior to building or modifying the stud wall framework to determine the exact size required. 2. Add 3/8” to width measurement (B) and at least 3/16” or more to depth measurement (A) of the shower floor to correctly size the framework opening. 3a. For new construction, build a wood or steel stud framework for the shower enclosure. Dry fit the shower floor. The ideal gap between the shower floor flange, each side wall framework and the back wall framework is 3/16”, as shown below. Note: When constructing or modifying stud wall framework, make sure to install (gang) multiple studs to provide support for any required moisture resistant wall board, solid surface panel attachment flanges, or filler boards, etc. Framework depth (B) must be at least 3/16” more than the actual depth measurement of the shower floor.

The shower floor is designed to be installed directly on the subfloor and should rest loosely against the stud wall framework maintaining the recommended 3/16” gap. Note: Barrier-free shower floor and ramp installation instructions are provided in a separate section in this manual. If the floor is not level and flat, the shower floor must be set in a bed of mortar to provide adequate support, as described in Step 2. Install the shower floor using a mortar mixture or an equivalent material, such as thinset. If the floor is perfectly level and flat, you may proceed directly to Step 1 below. 1. Place the shower floor into the rough opening. Level the shower floor in both directions. All support ribs and the front edge of the shower base must make firm contact with the subfloor. If any part of the shower floor is not completely supported, proceed to Step 2; if it is fully supported, proceed to Step 5. Note: Make sure the side and back flanges of the shower floor are parallel with the framework, with an even gap (recommended 3/16”) between the framework and the shower floor flanges. Note: Optional, but not required, fasten the shower floor to the framework by toe-nailing above the floor flange, refer to the Optional Shower Floor Toe-nailing Procedure section in this manual. Do not drive nails through any part of the shower base, as stated below. Do Not Use Nails To prevent damage to the shower floor and possible water or other damage to floors, pipes, walls, or other portions of your building or home, do not nail or screw throughthe shower floor to secure it to the framework. Nails are not necessary to hold the shower floor in place, but if nails are used they must be installed abovethe shower flange and not through it. Refer to the specific instructions in this manual for the proper installation of these optional nails. Note: The ideal installation results when the outside surface of the wall board and shower floor flange are flush, as shown in the illustration below. This dimension allows the Swan wall panels or alternate shower wall material, to rest against the lip of the shower floor once the moisture-resistant wall board is installed, as shown in the second illustration below. Note: Steps 2-4 must be used for uneven floors that do not provide complete support under the base. 2. Place up to a 1/2” thick slurry of fast-drying cement or mortar on the floor. Mix enough material to cover the area under the shower floor. This will ensure complete contact and support by the existing subfloor, eliminating shower floor flex during normal use",

  "The shower floor must be set in a bed of mortar to properly hold it in place. Nails may also be added, but are not necessary to hold the shower floor in place. To prevent damage to the shower floor and possible water or other damage to floors, pipes, walls, or other portions of your building or home, do not nail or screw throughany part of the shower floor. If nails are used, they must be installed abovethe shower floor flange and not through it. 1. Drive large head (roofing) nails into the studs just abovethe top of the shower floor flange, at a slight downward angle until the head is flush with the edge of the shower floor lip. 2. Tap the head of the nail downward so it is just above the flange.Do notput side or downward pressure against the flange. Care and Cleaning Swan products are stain and abrasion resistant; however, the finish requires reasonable care. Because cleaning products change over time, always check the manufacturer’s instructions to make sure it is compatible with plastic. DO NOT use a cleaner if the label indicates it should not be used on plastics. DO NOT use spray-on cleaners that require daily use without immediately rinsing with water to stop the chemical cleaning reaction because damage will result and void the warranty. Day-To-Day Cleanup Simply wipe the surfaces with a clean towel to remove watermarks and residues. All Swan products can be cleaned with warm water, a soft cloth, and normal household detergents or cleansers, such as Fantastic, Formula 409, Clorox Clean-up, Handy Andy, Mr. Clean, or Lestoil. Always rinse off cleaners within five minutes of application. If necessary, use an abrasive cleaner such as Ajax or Comet with a nylon brush or pad to remove build up on the shower floor pebble surface.Do Notuse steel wool or a wire brush. This will damage the surface. Caulking Joints If silicone caulking was applied after installation of the wall panels or tile, inspect the caulking joints monthly for damage or any signs of separation from the mating surface. Cracks in the caulking will allow water to leak into the surrounding surfaces.Reapply caulking to any joint showing signs of wear or cracking.Failure to inspect and repair caulking joints will void the warranty. Surface Repair Light Scratches Use 400 grit sandpaper to remove light scratches in the surface. Deep Scratches or Gouges For deeper scratches or gouges, use 220 or 320 grit sandpaper. A “Scotchbright pad” can be used to blend the repair into the surrounding area.
