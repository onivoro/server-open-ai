  "– BluePython Mar 31, 2016 at 4:24 Add a comment 0 I did exactly the steps as @linluk described but when I open a file with vim i don't see a result of the new installed Plugins. Fore example I installed the \\"powerline\\" plugin which should return at the bottom of my vim screen a fancy looking status line, but when I open a new File is still looks as before. The only plugin which worked for me is \\"YCM\\" (YouCompleteMe), but I can't explain why it works for YCM and not for powerline or other plugins like ultisnips.

The shower floor is designed to be installed directly on the subfloor and should rest loosely against the stud wall framework maintaining the recommended 3/16” gap. Note: Barrier-free shower floor and ramp installation instructions are provided in a separate section in this manual. If the floor is not level and flat, the shower floor must be set in a bed of mortar to provide adequate support, as described in Step 2. Install the shower floor using a mortar mixture or an equivalent material, such as thinset. If the floor is perfectly level and flat, you may proceed directly to Step 1 below. 1. Place the shower floor into the rough opening. Level the shower floor in both directions. All support ribs and the front edge of the shower base must make firm contact with the subfloor. If any part of the shower floor is not completely supported, proceed to Step 2; if it is fully supported, proceed to Step 5. Note: Make sure the side and back flanges of the shower floor are parallel with the framework, with an even gap (recommended 3/16”) between the framework and the shower floor flanges. Note: Optional, but not required, fasten the shower floor to the framework by toe-nailing above the floor flange, refer to the Optional Shower Floor Toe-nailing Procedure section in this manual. Do not drive nails through any part of the shower base, as stated below. Do Not Use Nails To prevent damage to the shower floor and possible water or other damage to floors, pipes, walls, or other portions of your building or home, do not nail or screw throughthe shower floor to secure it to the framework. Nails are not necessary to hold the shower floor in place, but if nails are used they must be installed abovethe shower flange and not through it. Refer to the specific instructions in this manual for the proper installation of these optional nails. Note: The ideal installation results when the outside surface of the wall board and shower floor flange are flush, as shown in the illustration below. This dimension allows the Swan wall panels or alternate shower wall material, to rest against the lip of the shower floor once the moisture-resistant wall board is installed, as shown in the second illustration below. Note: Steps 2-4 must be used for uneven floors that do not provide complete support under the base. 2. Place up to a 1/2” thick slurry of fast-drying cement or mortar on the floor. Mix enough material to cover the area under the shower floor. This will ensure complete contact and support by the existing subfloor, eliminating shower floor flex during normal use",
  "Do not place the material closer than 2” to the edge of the shower floor or the floor drain opening.

Place the shower floor into the rough opening and firmly press it into the mortar/thinset. The exposed front bottom edge(s) of the shower floor should contact the subfloor. 4. Level the shower floor in both directions, and allow the mortar/thinset to cure for 24 hours. Once cured, the mortar/thinset will prevent the shower floor from moving without the use of any mechanical fasteners. 5. Refer to Floor Drain Installation section in this manual to complete the shower floor installation procedure. Barrier-Free Shower Floor and Ramp Installation The barrier-free shower floor is designed to be installed directly on the subfloor and should fit in the rough opening with a recommended 3/16” gap between the shower floor and the framework. If the installation of the barrier-free shower floor requires the attachment of the barrier-free shower ramp, it is essential that the eight stainless steel clips, included with the ramp, be attached to the threshold of the barrier-free shower floor beforefinal installation. If the floor is not level and flat, the shower floor must be set in a bed of mortar to provide adequate support, as described in Step 5. Install the shower floor using a mortar mixture or an equivalent material, such as thinset. If the floor is perfectly level and flat, you may skip Step 5. 1. Attach each of the eight stainless steel clips to the underside of the shower floor threshold, positioned so they will be located between alternating structural ribs on the underside of the shower floor ramp. 2. Place the shower floor in the opening. Make sure the recommended 3/16” gap exists between the shower floor, the side wall framework, and the back wall framework. Note: The bottom of the clips must contact the subfloor. If necessary, shim under the barrier-free shower floor for subfloor contact to prevent the clips from being dislodged.

Place up to a 1/2” thick slurry of fast-drying cement or mortar on the floor. This will ensure complete contact and support by the existing subfloor, eliminating shower floor flex during normal use. Taper the mortar/thinset to 1/4” thick around the floor drain. Mix enough material to cover the area under the shower floor. Do not place the material closer than 2” to the edge of the shower floor or the drain opening. 5b. With the stainless steel clips installed on the threshold, place the barrier-free shower floor into the framework and firmly press it into the mortar/thinset. The outer perimeter of the shower floor should contact the subfloor. 5c. Level the barrier-free shower floor in both directions, and allow the mortar/thinset to cure for 24 hours. Once cured, the mortar/thinset will prevent the shower floor from moving without the use of any mechanical fasteners. Note: Clean up any excess mortar/thinset and allow the mortar/thinset under the barrier-free shower floor ramp to cure for 24 hours. 5d. Place the barrier-free shower floor ramp into a slurry of fast-drying cement or mortar and all eight of the stainless steel clips to prevent the shower ramp from moving. The front (thin) edge of the shower floor ramp must completely contact the floor surface. 6. Apply a bead of 100% silicone sealant to seal the joint between the shower floor and shower floor ramp. Note: If the shower walls extend past the shower floor, apply a bead of silicone sealant at the joint where the walls and shower floor ramp meet. Installation Procedure The Swan Corporation – Swanstone16800-325-7008 Floor Drain Installation If no-hub, cast-iron drain pipe is used, make sure the end of the pipe is free of nicks, cuts, or burrs. To ensure a proper seal, lightly sand the outside of the drain pipe with emery paper or “0000” steel wool. 1. Lubricate both caulk seal gasket (1) and drain pipe (2) with either liquid hand soap or dishwashing liquid, and slide the caulk seal gasket over the drain pipe. 2. Complete the installation by snapping strainer plates (3) into place. With metal strainers, it may be necessary to bend the strainer tines slightly outward. Note: If you need to pry the strainer up from the drain, you have a proper fit. 3. Place cardboard, or similar scratch resistant material, in the bottom of the shower floor to prevent possible damage during further construction. The shower floor/floor installation is now complete. DO NOT discard these installation instructions. PLEASE LEAVE THEM WITH THE HOMEOWNER",
  "The shower floor must be set in a bed of mortar to properly hold it in place. Nails may also be added, but are not necessary to hold the shower floor in place. To prevent damage to the shower floor and possible water or other damage to floors, pipes, walls, or other portions of your building or home, do not nail or screw throughany part of the shower floor. If nails are used, they must be installed abovethe shower floor flange and not through it. 1. Drive large head (roofing) nails into the studs just abovethe top of the shower floor flange, at a slight downward angle until the head is flush with the edge of the shower floor lip. 2. Tap the head of the nail downward so it is just above the flange.Do notput side or downward pressure against the flange. Care and Cleaning Swan products are stain and abrasion resistant; however, the finish requires reasonable care. Because cleaning products change over time, always check the manufacturer’s instructions to make sure it is compatible with plastic. DO NOT use a cleaner if the label indicates it should not be used on plastics. DO NOT use spray-on cleaners that require daily use without immediately rinsing with water to stop the chemical cleaning reaction because damage will result and void the warranty. Day-To-Day Cleanup Simply wipe the surfaces with a clean towel to remove watermarks and residues. All Swan products can be cleaned with warm water, a soft cloth, and normal household detergents or cleansers, such as Fantastic, Formula 409, Clorox Clean-up, Handy Andy, Mr. Clean, or Lestoil. Always rinse off cleaners within five minutes of application. If necessary, use an abrasive cleaner such as Ajax or Comet with a nylon brush or pad to remove build up on the shower floor pebble surface.Do Notuse steel wool or a wire brush. This will damage the surface. Caulking Joints If silicone caulking was applied after installation of the wall panels or tile, inspect the caulking joints monthly for damage or any signs of separation from the mating surface. Cracks in the caulking will allow water to leak into the surrounding surfaces.Reapply caulking to any joint showing signs of wear or cracking.Failure to inspect and repair caulking joints will void the warranty. Surface Repair Light Scratches Use 400 grit sandpaper to remove light scratches in the surface. Deep Scratches or Gouges For deeper scratches or gouges, use 220 or 320 grit sandpaper. A “Scotchbright pad” can be used to blend the repair into the surrounding area.
