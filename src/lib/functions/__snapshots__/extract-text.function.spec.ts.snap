important points to ensure a smooth installation.
•  Completely read and understand this manual and
the appropriate shower solid surface wall panel
installation manual prior to beginning the project.
•  Measure the actual shower floor and use these
dimensions to build or modify the stud wall
framework to fit.  A 3/16” gap between the
framework and the Swanstone shower floor flange
is acceptable.
Installation Options
The shower floor can be installed with the flange
directly against the stud wall framework and 1/2”
moisture-resistant wall board installed above the
shower floor flange.
The shower floor can be installed with the flange
directly against the stud wall framework and a Swan
Corporation SA Series Alcove Wall Kit can be
installed directly onto the wall stud framework.  Refer
to the alcove wall kit manual for more information,
prior to building/modifying the framework.
The shower floor can be installed with the flange
against existing moisture-resistant wall board with a
second layer of 1/2” moisture-resistant wall board
added above the shower floor flange.
If  installing  a  Swan  Corporation  Alcove  Wall  Kit  in
conjunction  with  the  shower  floor,  note  that  the  alcove
side panels are designed to extend out past the edge of
the  shower  floor.    Read  the  Alcove  Wall  Kit  installation
manual  and  build  the  framework  to  the  specifications
outlined in that publication.
Framework Construction

Installation Procedure

Standard Shower Floor Installation
These instructions cover the installation of any square,
rectangular, or neo-angle shower floor.  The shower floor
is designed to be installed directly on the subfloor and
should rest loosely against the stud wall framework
maintaining the recommended 3/16” gap.
Note:  Barrier-free shower floor and ramp installation
instructions are provided in a separate section in this
manual.
If the floor is not level and flat, the shower floor must be
set in a bed of mortar to provide adequate support, as
described in Step 2.  Install the shower floor using a
mortar mixture or an equivalent material, such as
thinset.  If the floor is perfectly level and flat, you may
proceed directly to Step 1 below.
1.   Place the shower floor into the rough opening.
Level the shower floor in both directions.  All support
ribs and the front edge of the shower base must
make firm contact with the subfloor.  If any part of
the shower floor is not completely supported,
proceed to Step 2; if it is fully supported, proceed to
Step 5.
Note:  Make sure the side and back flanges of the
shower floor are parallel with the framework, with an
even gap (recommended 3/16”) between the framework
and the shower floor flanges.
Note:  Optional, but not required, fasten the shower floor
to the framework by toe-nailing above the floor flange,
refer to the Optional Shower Floor Toe-nailing Procedure
section in this manual.  Do not drive nails through any
part of the shower base, as stated below.
Do Not Use Nails
To  prevent  damage  to  the  shower  floor  and
possible water or other damage to floors, pipes,
walls,  or  other  portions  of  your  building  or
home,  do  not  nail  or  screw  throughthe  shower  floor  to
secure  it  to  the  framework.    Nails  are  not  necessary  to
hold  the  shower  floor  in  place,  but  if  nails  are  used  they
must  be  installed  abovethe  shower  flange  and  not
through it.  Refer to the specific instructions in this manual
for the proper installation of these optional nails.
Note:   The ideal installation results when the outside
surface of the wall board and shower floor flange are
flush, as shown in the illustration below.  This dimension
allows the Swan wall panels or alternate shower wall
material, to rest against the lip of the shower floor once
the moisture-resistant wall board is installed, as shown
in the second illustration below.
Note:  Steps 2-4 must be used for uneven floors that
do not provide complete support under the base.
2.  Place up to a 1/2” thick slurry of fast-drying cement
or mortar on the floor.  Mix enough material to cover
the area under the shower floor.  This will ensure
complete contact and support by the existing
subfloor, eliminating shower floor flex during normal
use.  Taper the mortar/thinset to 1/4” thick around
the floor drain.  Do not place the material closer than
2” to the edge of the shower floor or the floor drain
opening.

procedure.
Barrier-Free Shower Floor and Ramp
Installation
The barrier-free shower floor is designed to be installed
directly on the subfloor and should fit in the rough
opening with a recommended 3/16” gap between the
shower floor and the framework.
If the installation of the barrier-free shower floor requires
the attachment of the barrier-free shower ramp, it is
essential that the eight stainless steel clips, included
with the ramp, be attached to the threshold of the
barrier-free shower floor beforefinal installation.
If the floor is not level and flat, the shower floor must be
set in a bed of mortar to provide adequate support, as
described in Step 5.  Install the shower floor using a
mortar mixture or an equivalent material, such as
thinset.  If the floor is perfectly level and flat, you may
skip Step 5.
1.   Attach each of the eight stainless steel clips to the
underside of the shower floor threshold, positioned
so they will be located between alternating structural
ribs on the underside of the shower floor ramp.
2.   Place the shower floor in the opening.  Make sure
the recommended 3/16” gap exists between the
shower floor, the side wall framework, and the back
wall framework.
Note:  The bottom of the clips must contact the subfloor.
If necessary, shim under the barrier-free shower floor for
subfloor contact to prevent the clips from being
dislodged.

Installation Procedure

3.   Level the barrier-free shower floor in both directions
and make sure all support ribs and the front edge of
the shower base make firm contact with the subfloor.
If any part of the shower floor is not completely
supported, proceed to Steps 5a through 5d; if it is
fully supported, skip Step 5.
Note:  Optional, but not required, fasten the shower floor
to the framework by toe-nailing above the floor flange,
refer to the Optional Shower Floor Toe-nailing Procedure
section in this manual.  Do not drive nails through any
part of the shower base, as stated below.
Do Not Use Nails
To  prevent  damage  to  the  shower  floor  and
possible water or other damage to floors, pipes,
walls,  or  other  portions  of  your  building  or
home,  do  not  nail  or  screw  throughthe  shower  floor  to
secure  it  to  the  framework.    Nails  are  not  necessary  to
hold  the  shower  floor  in  place,  but  if  nails  are  used  they
must  be  installed  abovethe  shower  flange  and  not
through it.  Refer to the specific instructions in this manual
for the proper installation of these optional nails.
Note:   The ideal installation results when the outside
surface of the wall board and shower floor flange are
flush, as shown in the illustration below.  This dimension
allows the Swan wall panels or alternate shower wall
material, to rest against the lip of the shower floor once
the moisture-resistant wall board is installed, as shown
in the second illustration below.
Note:  The barrier-free shower floor ramp can be
installed on the same floor surface as the shower floor
or can be installed on raised floor surface (up to 1/2”
thick), as shown below.
4.   Place the barrier-free shower floor ramp into all eight
of the stainless steel clips to prevent the shower
ramp from moving.  The front (thin) edge of the
shower floor ramp must completely contact the floor
surface.

Installation Procedure

Note:  Step 5 must be used for uneven floors that do
not provide complete support under the base.
5a.  Place up to a 1/2” thick slurry of fast-drying cement
or mortar on the floor.  This will ensure complete
contact and support by the existing subfloor,
eliminating shower floor flex during normal use.
Taper the mortar/thinset to 1/4” thick around the
floor drain.  Mix enough material to cover the area
under the shower floor.  Do not place the material
closer than 2” to the edge of the shower floor or the
drain opening.
5b.  With the stainless steel clips installed on the
threshold, place the barrier-free shower floor into
the framework and firmly press it into the
mortar/thinset.  The outer perimeter of the shower
floor should contact the subfloor.
5c.  Level the barrier-free shower floor in both directions,
and allow the mortar/thinset to cure for 24 hours.
Once cured, the mortar/thinset will prevent the
shower floor from moving without the use of any
mechanical fasteners.
Note:  Clean up any excess mortar/thinset and allow the
mortar/thinset under the barrier-free shower floor ramp
to cure for 24 hours.
5d.  Place the barrier-free shower floor ramp into a slurry
of fast-drying cement or mortar and all eight of the
stainless steel clips to prevent the shower ramp
from moving.  The front (thin) edge of the shower
floor ramp must completely contact the floor
surface.
6.   Apply a bead of 100% silicone sealant to seal the
joint between the shower floor and shower floor
ramp.
Note:  If the shower walls extend past the shower floor,
apply a bead of silicone sealant at the joint where the
walls and shower floor ramp meet.

Floor Drain Installation
If no-hub, cast-iron drain pipe is used, make sure the
end of the pipe is free of nicks, cuts, or burrs.  To ensure
a proper seal, lightly sand the outside of the drain pipe
with emery paper or “0000” steel wool.
1.   Lubricate both caulk seal gasket (1) and drain pipe
(2) with either liquid hand soap or dishwashing
liquid, and slide the caulk seal gasket over the drain
pipe.
2.   Complete the installation by snapping strainer plates
(3) into place.  With metal strainers, it may be
necessary to bend the strainer tines slightly outward.
Note:  If you need to pry the strainer up from the drain,
you have a proper fit.
3.   Place cardboard, or similar scratch resistant
material, in the bottom of the shower floor to prevent
possible damage during further construction.
The shower floor/floor installation is now
complete.  DO NOT discard these installation
instructions.  PLEASE LEAVE THEM WITH THE
HOMEOWNER.

Optional Shower Floor Toe-nailing Procedure
If desired, after the shower floor has been set into a
mortar base and leveled, follow this optional procedure
for toe-nailing the shower floor to the framework.
The shower floor must be set in a bed of mortar
to properly hold it in place.  Nails may also be
added,  but  are  not  necessary  to  hold  the
shower  floor  in  place.    To  prevent  damage  to
the  shower  floor  and  possible  water  or  other  damage  to
floors,  pipes,  walls,  or  other  portions  of  your  building  or
home,  do  not  nail  or  screw  throughany  part  of  the
shower  floor.    If  nails  are  used,  they  must  be  installed
abovethe shower floor flange and not through it.
1.   Drive large head (roofing) nails into the studs just
abovethe top of the shower floor flange, at a slight
downward angle until the head is flush with the edge
of the shower floor lip.
2.   Tap the head of the nail downward so it is just above
the flange.Do notput side or downward pressure
against the flange.
Care and Cleaning
Swan products are stain and abrasion resistant;
however, the finish requires reasonable care.
Because  cleaning  products  change  over  time,  always
check  the  manufacturer’s  instructions  to  make  sure  it  is
compatible  with  plastic.    DO  NOT  use  a  cleaner  if  the
label indicates it should not be used on plastics.  DO NOT
use  spray-on  cleaners  that  require  daily  use  without
immediately  rinsing  with  water  to  stop  the  chemical
cleaning reaction because damage will result and void the
warranty.
Day-To-Day Cleanup
Simply wipe the surfaces with a clean towel to remove
watermarks and residues.  All Swan products can be
cleaned with warm water, a soft cloth, and normal
household detergents or cleansers, such as Fantastic,
Formula 409, Clorox Clean-up, Handy Andy, Mr. Clean,
or Lestoil.  Always rinse off cleaners within five minutes
of application.
If necessary, use an abrasive cleaner such as Ajax or
Comet with a nylon brush or pad to remove build up on
the shower floor pebble surface.Do Notuse steel wool
or a wire brush.  This will damage the surface.
Caulking Joints
If silicone caulking was applied after installation of the
wall panels or tile, inspect the caulking joints monthly for
damage or any signs of separation from the mating
surface.  Cracks in the caulking will allow water to leak
into the surrounding surfaces.Reapply caulking to
any joint showing signs of wear or cracking.Failure
to inspect and repair caulking joints will void the
warranty.
Surface Repair
Light Scratches
Use 400 grit sandpaper to remove light scratches in the
surface.
Deep Scratches or Gouges
For deeper scratches or gouges, use 220 or 320 grit
sandpaper.  A “Scotchbright pad” can be used to blend
the repair into the surrounding area.
